<h1 align="center">Book Store App Development<br>using React Native</h1>

### Indroduction 
<p align="justify">One of the simplest mobile applications you can build with React Native is a Book app for a good reader. As a complete beginner in mobile application development, building a simple Book app can be a great way to get started with React Native. There should be screens to login or register for the book app. The books list should be displayed and there should be a way to sort the books category wise. If user clicked on a book user should be navigated to the details such as author,title of the particular book. And user should be able to search the book using its name.</p>



*Features to be implemented in the book app*
- User Login & Registration screens
- Navigation (Drawer or Tab Bar)
- Books Lists & Categories Lists
- Books Details screen (including author, description, book cover photo,price, etc)
- Book Search functionality
